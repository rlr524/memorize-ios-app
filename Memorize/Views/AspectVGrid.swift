struct AspectVGrid<Item, ItemView>: View where ItemView: View, Item: Identifiable {
    var items: [Item]
    var aspectRatio: CGFloat
    var content: (Item) -> ItemView

    /*
     Why use @escaping on the content parameter? The closure expression it is
     passed as a value, (Item) -> ItemView "escapes" from the context of this init.
     It is assigned above as the content var and then used below in the body
     declaration as "content". This is only an issue with closures. The @escaping
     attribute tells the compiler it's ok that this closure is executed inline, no
     memory needs to be created (since closures are function types and therefore
     passed by reference). If the closure isn't escaping, the compiler would
     otherwise create memory which isn't necessary. The var "content" above is
     pointing to the (Item) -> ItemView function it is passed as a value and memory
     is created. That isn't needed in this case. *FROM Swift Docs: A closure is said
     to escape a function when the closure is passed as an argument to the function,
     but is called after the function returns. When you declare a function that
     takes a closure as one of its parameters, you can write @escaping before the
     parameter’s type to indicate that the closure is allowed to escape. One way
     that a closure can escape is by being stored in a variable that’s defined
     outside the function. As an example, many functions that start an asynchronous
     operation take a closure argument as a completion handler. The function
     returns after it starts the operation, but the closure isn’t called until the
     operation is completed—the closure needs to escape, to be called later.
